# geng-gltf
## This is a simple glTF library for the [geng](https://geng.kuviman.com) game engine

Features:
- Rendering meshes with colors, textures and materials (PBR) (It's not intended for rendering full scenes with cameras and stuff)
- Simple skinning
- Skeletal animations (I don't plan supporting animation of any other node, because this will require a complete rewrite)
